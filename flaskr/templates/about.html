  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>I heard a saying for the first time a couple days ago. It was said in an off-handed way that made me feel as though it was common knowledge, but it hit me. It went, "In your twenties all you care about is what people think about you. In your thirties you don't care what anyone thinks about you. In your forties you realize no one was thinking about you all along."</p>
